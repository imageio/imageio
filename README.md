<p class='summary'>
Imageio is a Python library that provides an easy interface to read and
write a wide range of image data, including animated images, video,
volumetric data, and scientific formats. It is cross-platform, runs on
Python 3.5+, and is easy to install.
</p>

<p>
    Professional support is available via <a href='https://tidelift.com/funding/github/pypi/imageio'>Tidelift</a> and <a href='https://xscode.com/almarklein/imageio'>xs:code</a>.
</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
Here's a minimal example of how to use imageio. See the docs for
<a href='https://imageio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples.html'>more examples</a>.

```python
import imageio
im = imageio.imread('imageio:chelsea.png')  # read a standard image
im.shape  # im is a NumPy array
>> (300, 451, 3)
imageio.imwrite('~/chelsea-gray.jpg', im[:, :, 0])
```

<h2>API in a nutshell</h2>
As a user, you just have to remember a handful of functions:

<ul>
    <li>imread() and imwrite() - for single images</li>
    <li>mimread() and mimwrite() - for image series (animations)</li>
    <li>volread() and volwrite() - for volumetric image data</li>
    <li>get_reader() and get_writer() - for more control (e.g. streaming or compression)</li>
    <li>See the <a href='https://imageio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/userapi.html'>user api</a> for more information</li>
</ul>


<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Simple interface via a concise set of functions</li>
    <li>Easy to <a href='https://imageio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html'>install</a> using Conda or pip</li>
    <li>Few dependencies (only NumPy and Pillow)</li>
    <li>Pure Python, runs on Python 3.5+, and PyPy</li>
    <li>Cross platform, runs on Windows, Linux, macOS</li>
    <li>Lots of supported <a href='https://imageio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/formats.html'>formats</a></li>
    <li>Can read from file names, file objects, zipfiles, http/ftp, and raw bytes</li>
    <li>Easy to extend using plugins</li>
    <li>Code quality is maintained with many tests and continuous integration</li>
</ul>


<h2>Dependencies</h2>

Minimal requirements:
<ul>
    <li>Python 3.5+</li>
    <li>NumPy</li>
    <li>Pillow</li>
</ul>

Optional Python packages:
<ul>
    <li>imageio-ffmpeg (for working with video files)</li>
    <li>itk or SimpleITK (for ITK formats)</li>
    <li>astropy (for FITS plugin)</li>
    <li>osgeo (for GDAL plugin)</li>
    <li><a href='https://codeberg.org/monilophyta/imageio-flif'>imageio-flif</a> (for working with <a href='https://github.com/FLIF-hub/FLIF'>FLIF</a> image files)</li>
</ul>

Still on an earlier version of Python? Imageio version 2.6.x supports Python 2.7 and 3.4.

<h2>imageio for enterprise</h2>

Available as part of the Tidelift Subscription.

The maintainers of imageio and thousands of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver commercial support and maintenance for the open source dependencies you use to build your applications. Save time, reduce risk, and improve code health, while paying the maintainers of the exact dependencies you use.

<h2>Details</h2>
<p>
Imageio has a relatively simple core that provides a common interface
to different file formats. This core takes care of reading from different
sources (like http), and exposes a simple API for the plugins to access
the raw data. All file formats are implemented in plugins. Additional
plugins can easily be registered.
</p><p>
Imageio provides a wide range of image formats, including scientific
formats. Any help with implementing more formats is very welcome!
</p><p>
The codebase adheres to (a subset of) the PEP8 style guides. We strive
for maximum test coverage (100% for the core, >95% for each plugin).

<h2>Contributing</h2>

<p>Install imageio in edit mode, with dev tools:</p>
```bash
pip install -e .[dev,docs]
```

<p>Most developer command are done via <code>invoke</code>.</p>

```bash
# Check all available commands
invoke -l
# Reformat code (using Black)
invoke format
# Check for style errors
invoke lint
# Run unit tests
invoke test --unit
# Check test coverage (re-runs tests)
invoke test --cover
```
