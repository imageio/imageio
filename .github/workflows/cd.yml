# This action handles ImageIOs automatic releasing. It performs the following steps:
#
# - check for any new commits to master in fixed intervals (if none, exit)
# - check if they require a new semver version (if no, exit)
# - run through full unit-tests (if they fail, exit)
# - check if the docs build without warnings (if they fail, exit)
# - check if the wheel can be built (if it fails, exit)
# - bump ImageIO's version
# - update the changelog with the changes made (breaking, feature, fix, doc,
#   ...)
# - commit, tag, and push the new version + changelog to master (this also
#   pushes the new tag)
# - build the new imageIO version
# - release the new version to GitHub and PyPI
