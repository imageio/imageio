    """Read an ndimage from a URI.

    Opens the given URI and reads an ndimage from it. The exact behavior
    depends on both the file type and plugin used to open the file. To learn
    about the exact behavior, check the documentation of the relevant plugin.
    Typically, imread attempts to read all data stored in the URI.

    Parameters
    ----------
    uri : {str, pathlib.Path, bytes, file}
        The resource to load the image from, e.g. a filename, pathlib.Path,
        http address or file object, see the docs for more info.
    index : {int, None}
        If the URI contains multiple ndimages, select the index-th ndimage
        from among them and return it. The exact behavior is plugin dependent.
    plugin : {str, None}
        The plugin to use. If set to None (default) imread will perform a
        search for a matching plugin. If not None, this takes priority over
        the provided format hint  (if present).
    format_hint : str
        A format hint to help optimize plugin selection given as the format's
        extension, e.g. ".png". This can speed up the selection process for
        ImageResources that don't have an explicit extension, e.g. streams, or
        for ImageResources where the extension does not match the resource's
        content.
    **kwargs :
        Additional keyword arguments will be passed to the plugin's read call.

    Returns
    -------
    image : ndimage
        The ndimage located at the given URI.

    Opens the given URI and reads the properties of an ndimage from it. The

    used. Further, any field will be, where possible, populated with a sensible
    default (may be `None`) if the ImageResource does not declare a value in its
    metadata.

    Parameters
    ----------
    index : int
        The index of the ndimage for which to return properties. If the
        index is out of bounds a ``ValueError`` is raised. If ``None``,
        return the properties for the ndimage stack. If this is impossible,
        e.g., due to shape missmatch, an exception will be raised.
    plugin : {str, None}
