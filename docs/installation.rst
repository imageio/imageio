Installing imageio
==================

Imageio is written in pure Python, so installation is easy. 
Imageio works on Python 2.7 and 3.4+. It also works on Pypy.
Imageio depends on Numpy and Pillow. For some formats, imageio needs
additional libraries/executables (e.g. ffmpeg), which imageio helps you
download and store in a folder in your application data.

To install imageio, use one of the following methods:
    
* If you are in a conda env: ``conda install -c conda-forge imageio``
* If you have pip: ``pip install imageio``
* Good old ``python setup.py install``

For developers, we provide a simple mechanism to allow importing 
imageio from the cloned repository. See the file ``imageio.proxy.io`` for
details.
