Plan for dropping support for Python 2.7
========================================

Starting on January 1, 2020, imageio will stop supporting Python 2.7.
The latest release that still supports Python 2.7 will remain available
on Pypi and conda-forge. A branch will be made that may be used to
continue supporting 2.7, but one should not expect (free) contributions
from the imageio developers there.
