API Reference
=============

ImageIO's API follows the usual idea of choosing sensible defaults for the average use, but giving
you fine grained control 

Core API (Basic Usage)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The API documented in this section is shared by all plugins

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    Core API v2.9 <userapi>


Plugins & Backend Libraries (Advanced Usage)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes, you need to do more than just "load an image, done". Sometimes you
need to use a very specific feature of a very specific backend. ImageIOs allows
you to do so by allowing its plugins to extend the core API. Typically this is
done in the form of additional keyword arguments (``kwarg``). Below you can find
a list of available plugins and which arguments they support.
