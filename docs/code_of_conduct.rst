Code of Conduct
===============

TL:DR
------

- Be professional, kind, and don't insult others.
- Strive to create an environment of learning and healthy discussion. 
- Don't bully people.

Introduction
------------

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the ImageIO project,
including all public and private mailing lists, issue trackers, wikis, blogs,
Twitter, and any other communication channel used by our community. 

This Code of Conduct should be honored by everyone who participates in the
ImageIO community formally or informally, or claims any affiliation with the
project, in any project-related activities and especially when representing the
project, in any role.

This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distil our common
understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals. Please try to
follow this code in spirit as much as in letter, to create a friendly and
productive environment that enriches the surrounding community.

Specific Guidelines
-------------------

We strive to:

1.	Be open. We invite anyone to participate in our community. We prefer to use
  	public methods of communication for project-related messages, unless
  	discussing something sensitive. This applies to messages for help or
  	project-related support, too; not only is a public support request much more
  	likely to result in an answer to a question, but it also ensures that any
  	inadvertent mistakes in answering are more easily detected and corrected.
2.	Be empathetic, welcoming, friendly, and patient. We work together to resolve
  	conflict and assume good intentions. A community where people feel
  	uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
3.	Be collaborative. Our work will be used by other people, and in turn we will
  	depend on the work of others. When we make something for the benefit of the
  	project, we are willing to explain to others how it works, so that they can
  	build on the work to make it even better. Any decision we make will affect
  	users and colleagues, and we take those consequences seriously when making
  	decisions.
4.	Be inquisitive. Nobody knows everything! Asking questions early avoids many
  	problems later, so we encourage questions, although we may direct them to
  	the appropriate forum. We will try hard to be responsive and helpful.
5.	Be careful in the words that we choose. We are careful and respectful in our
  	communication, and we take responsibility for our own speech. Be kind to
  	others. Do not insult or put down other participants. We will not accept
  	harassment or other exclusionary behaviour, such as

        - Violent threats or language directed against another person.
        - Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
        - Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
        - Unwelcome sexual attention.
        - Excessive profanity.
        - Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop,
          then stop.
        - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.

Diversity Statement
-------------------

The ImageIO project welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. We are
committed to being a community that everyone enjoys being part of. Although we
may not always be able to accommodate each individual's preferences, we try our
best to treat everyone kindly.

Though we welcome people fluent in all languages, ImageIO development is
conducted in English.

Standards for behaviour in the ImageIO community are detailed in the Code of
Conduct above. Participants in our community should uphold these standards in
all their interactions.

Reporting Guidelines
--------------------

We know that it is possible for internet communication to devolve into obvious
and flagrant abuse. We also recognize that sometimes people may have a bad day
or be unaware of some of the guidelines in this Code of Conduct. Please keep
this in mind when deciding on how to respond to a breach of this Code.

For clearly intentional breaches, report those to the Code of Conduct Committee
(see below). For possibly unintentional breaches, you may reply to the person
and point out this code of conduct (either in public or in private, whatever is
most appropriate). If you would prefer not to do that, please feel free to
report to the Code of Conduct Committee directly, or ask the Committee for
advice, in confidence.

Currently, the Committee consists of:

- Sebastian Wallk√∂tter

If your report involves any members of the Committee, or if they feel they have
a conflict of interest in handling it, then they will recuse themselves from
considering your report.

Incident reporting resolution & Code of Conduct enforcement
-----------------------------------------------------------

We will investigate and respond to all complaints. The ImageIO Code of Conduct
Committee will protect the identity of the reporter and treat the content of
complaints as confidential (unless the reporter agrees otherwise). Please see
:doc:`Code of Conduct Reporting Guidelines <code_of_conduct_reporting>` for
details on this procedure.
