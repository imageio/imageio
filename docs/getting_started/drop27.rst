Depreciating Python 2.7
=======================

Python 2.7 is deprecated from 2020. For more information on the
scientific Python ecosystem's transition to Python3 only, see the
python3-statement_.

Imageio 2.6.x is the last release to support Python 2.7. This release
will remain available on Pypi and conda-forge. The `py2` branch may be used to
continue supporting 2.7, but one should not expect (free) contributions
from the imageio developers.

For more information on porting your code to run on Python 3, see the
python3-howto_.
